# ConvNetC++
C++ port of [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) and [ConvNetSharp](https://github.com/cbovar/ConvNetSharp). You can use ConvNetC++ to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks 
(CNN).

Thank you very much to the original author (Andrej Karpathy), C# translator (CÃ©dric Bovar) and to all the contributors to ConvNetJS!

## Example
